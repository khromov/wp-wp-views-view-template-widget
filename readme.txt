Allows you to add a Widget that displays a View Template from Toolset Views

== Description ==
View Template Widget is useful for inserting information boxes about the current post being displayed in the widget area of your theme.
It is possible to configure which content types each widget will be shown on.

This plugin requires Toolset Views. Click the link below for more information on this plugin:

**Usage**

*Basic usage*

* Activate Views for Wordpress
* Create a View Template
* Add a WP Views Template widget to your site

The title field supports shortcodes, so you can easily use a wpv- shortcode in the widget title.

Although it is possible to expose the widget on all pages by selecting "Show widget everywhere", it is most useful on predefined post types, as 
archives, listings and tag pages will only return one result. (Most often the first item in the archive.)

To display a listing in the widget area, use a View Widget instead. (Included in Views.)
